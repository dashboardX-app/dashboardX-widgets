A powerful desktop widget app for windows, built with Vue and Tauri.
## Still in development
- Currently only runs on windows (uses native API to position the window behind all other windows)
- Widgets can only be edited by changing source code (need to make a widget loader)
- Contributions are welcome
## How to run
- Install [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites)
- Clone the repository
- Run these commands -
  
  ```
  yarn
  ```
  ```
  yarn tauri dev
  ```
- You will need to install 'Anurati Regular' and 'Space Mono' fonts to get the result seen in the screenshot. You can also change the code to use different fonts.
